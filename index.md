### Welcome!!
Hello Folks! I am Sunny Bangale, a graduate student at UT Dallas, TX pursuing Master of Science in Computer Science (Expected graduation May 2019).<br>
I believe in a balance of academics and non scholastic activities- an important factor to enhance one's all round personality. <br>
Apart from being a developer and a programming enthusiast, I am a photographer, artist, singer and a music lover. <br>
View my projects on GITHUB and find the description in the README file. <br>
I hope you like them.... 

### My Objective
The whole world steps aside for the man who knows where he's going...
I want to be involved in creative and constructive work that would not only satisfy my appetite for learning and serving common people but, also boost my skills that can prove to be beneficial for the society as a whole. I want to innovate for the future.
