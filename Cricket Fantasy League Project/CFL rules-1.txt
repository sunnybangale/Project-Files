But, on a day when India is not playing you want to keep Eoin Morgan as your captain. This will count as 1 substitution. Shifting back to Kohli from Morgan will not count as a substitution.
If you are fed up with Kohli's performance and want to make someone who is playing well, say Shane Watson your permanent captain, you can do so at the expense of 2 substitutions.
