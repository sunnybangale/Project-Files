Getting started

1.Download Raspian image from the given website - http://downloads.raspberrypi.org/images/raspbian/2012-12-16-wheezy-raspbian/2012-12-16-wheezy-raspbian.zip

2.Copy it to the memory card.If copying from windows use Windows disk manager.If copying from linux follow following steps - 
Find the name of the device of the plugged in SD-card. For instance I typed ls -la /dev/sd*before and after plugging in the sd-card. I saw the date of /dev/sdc change and thus decided that that was the one.
Find the place of the unzipped image, which was /home/username/Downloads/2012-10-28-wheezy-raspbian.img for me.
               Type the following
               Sudo dd if=img location op=/dev/sdc
